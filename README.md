This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

The goal of this project is to scrape data from the Spotify API. 

It has a user profile component, a Now Playing kinda widget, and top tracks of the user.

## Getting Started

Before running the development server, create a .local.env file with your Spotify ID and SECRET

```bash
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
